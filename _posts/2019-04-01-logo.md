## Logo
This document is the next part of _"Brand and logo"_ and will put all my ideas and my final result.
### My ideas
I wanted to have a logo that represents community, to show that in group we can do more than alone. So I went into the animal reign. Looking up i felt that the wolf, the ant or a bee could be a good choice, I preferred the ant since we naturally feel them as a big working team, bringing each on a little piece of the edifice. I loved the ant's head design and decided to pick it up for our logo. However, I did make some logos for each animal and in a different style since i feel like they can at least show us other kind or designs and color usage.

In the other hand, I look through the metaphor of the seed and the field (that Nyomi likes a lot). The metaphor goes like that: our website is a field in which each contributor put his seed in a project. As the project grows, the contribution will grow as well. That's why I looked for wheat and seeds. It's vers poetical and is connected to the whole idea of our website.

For the color scheme I really wanted to stay into dark blue, orange, teal and light pink (the palette is presented in _design of a website_). I explained why we should use those according ot the effect it gives to the users.

### The final choice
We concluded that the seed could be our best option here. It's simple and we have a good idea on how to use it. Indeed I put on each seed a different color, through the website we will end up having some sections of each SDG's. So the idea is to change the logo's color depending on the section we are i.e if we want to look at SDG's number 4 "quality education" we can put some dark red/bordeaux etc. In other word the color scheme will change depending on where you are.
